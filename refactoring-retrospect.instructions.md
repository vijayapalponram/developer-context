# Refactoring

## Retrospect

Once refactoring is done, lets retrospect what are the changes done and write into a readme `/docs/refactoring/[title]/retrospective.md`.

When holding a retrospective after refactoring, the discussion should cover various aspects of the process and its outcomes. Here's a breakdown of key areas to retrospect:

- Goals and Expectations:
  - Were the initial goals for the refactoring clear and well-defined?
  - Did the refactoring achieve its intended goals (e.g., improved code readability, reduced complexity, better performance, easier extensibility)?
  - Were there any unmet expectations?
- The Refactoring Process Itself:
  - Planning: How effective was the planning phase? Was enough time allocated?
  - Small Steps: Was the refactoring done in small, manageable steps? If not, what challenges did that create?
  - Impact on Features/Deadlines: Did the refactoring disrupt ongoing feature development or impact deadlines? How could this be managed better next time?
  - Rollback Strategy: Was there a clear rollback strategy in case of issues? Was it effective?
  - Communication: How effective was communication within the team and with stakeholders during the refactoring?
  - Testing and Quality Assurance:

- Test Coverage: Was the test coverage sufficient before starting the refactoring?
  - Test Effectiveness: Did the existing tests adequately protect against regressions? Were new tests needed?
  - Bug Introduction: Were any new bugs introduced during refactoring? If so, why were they missed by tests?
  - QA Involvement: How effectively was the QA team involved?
  - Code Quality and Design:

- Actual Improvements: Is the code genuinely cleaner, more modular, and easier to understand now?
  - Maintainability: Has maintainability improved?
  - Performance: Was there any measurable impact on performance (positive or negative)?
  - "Code Smells": Were the targeted "code smells" effectively addressed? Were new ones created?
  - Architectural Implications: Did the refactoring reveal deeper architectural issues that need to be addressed in the future?

- Tools and Environment:
  - Were the refactoring tools (e.g., IDE features, static analysis tools) effective?
  - Was the development environment conducive to refactoring?
  - Was version control used effectively (e.g., frequent commits, clear commit messages)?

- Team Dynamics and Learnings:
  - What challenges did the team face?
  - What went exceptionally well that should be repeated?
  - What new skills or knowledge did team members gain?
  - Are there any specific practices or patterns that should be adopted or avoided in future refactoring efforts?
